"""FastAPI app tying the demo shop together.

Small, deliberately boring surface: enough real endpoints that GitHub Actions,
CodeQL, and Dependabot all have something to look at, without needing a
database. See config.py and image_utils.py for the CVE demo scenarios, and
pricing.py for the plain business logic used by test_flaky.py's history.
